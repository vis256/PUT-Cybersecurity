Summary on Generative AI

U.S copyright law has come under scrutiny with recent widespread adoption of Generative AI. Currently, the U.S Copyright Office says only works produced by humans can be copyrighted but this can change in the future. People willingly breaking those rules may force the court to decide on the eligibility of generative AI. Many notable artists have begun lawsuits against AI companies such as OpenAI. They argue the tech giants are stealing their work. On the other hand the companies insist they are operating  within the fair use policy.
